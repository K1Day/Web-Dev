        <p id="poem"><em>The mountains rise with silent grace,<br>
Their peaks adorned with winter's lace.<br>
A tranquil breeze, a whispering sound,<br>
In nature’s arms, peace can be found.<br>

I long to stand where skies are clear,<br>
To feel the air, so fresh, so near.<br>
In awe of heights, my spirit soars,<br>
Where mountains meet the open doors.</em></p>

Their towering peaks, covered in snow, seemed so far away, yet at the same time incredibly close. The nature around me was so vibrant and pure that I was able to truly feel in harmony with the world. The fresh mountain air filled me with energy, and the silence that reigned in these places brought peace and tranquility. It was an incredible journey that left a mark on my soul, and I’m happy I was able to experience such moments!</em></strong></p>
